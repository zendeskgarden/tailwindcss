# Contributing to Garden

Keen to contribute to Garden? We're stoked to have you join us. You may
find that opening an
[issue](https://github.com/zendeskgarden/tailwindcss/issues) is the
best way to get a conversation started. When you're ready to submit a
pull request, follow the [steps](#pull-request-workflow) below. We
follow a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) as our guide for
community behavior.

## Versioning Workflow

Garden follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). We release
patch versions for bugfixes, minor versions for new features, and major
versions for any breaking changes.

The [pull request workflow](#pull-request-workflow) along with the [PR
template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) will help us determine how to
version your contributions.

All changes are recorded in the [changelog](../CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Development Workflow

Before you start, be sure [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) is installed
on your system. After you clone this repo, run `yarn` to install
dependencies needed for development. After installation, the following
commands are available:

- `yarn test` to run package tests.
- `yarn lint` to enforce consistent code conventions. Note this is run
  as a git `pre-commit` hook.
- `yarn format` to enforce code style with opinionated formats. Note
  this is run as a git `pre-commit` hook.

## Pull Request Workflow

1. Fork the repo and create a branch. Format your branch name as
   `username/verb-noun`.
1. If you haven't yet, get comfortable with the [development
   environment](#development-workflow).
1. Regularly `git commit` locally and `git push` to the remote branch.
   Use whatever casual commit messaging you find suitable. We'll help
   you apply an appropriate squashed [conventional
   commit](https://conventionalcommits.org/) message when it's time to
   merge to the main branch.
1. If your changes result in a major modification, be sure all
   documentation is up-to-date.
1. When your branch is ready, open a new pull request via GitHub.
   The repo [PR template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) will guide you
   toward describing your contribution in a format that is ultimately
   suitable for a structured conventional commit (used to automatically
   advance the published package version).
1. Every PR must pass CI checks and receive at least one :+1: to be
   considered for merge.
1. Garden
   [maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/zendeskgarden/teams/maintainers)
   will manage the squashed merge to the main branch, using your PR title and
   description as the scope, description, and body for a conventional
   commit.
